NewPerspective v1.0 - Apache Thunder

Want to experience new perspective to Gungeon? With this mod you can enable "3D" mode which reveals the true underlying 3D nature of the game.

Simply use this command to enable:

perspective toggle3d

The room "occlusion" system will be adjusted to mostly work with the new perspective but it's not perfect. 
If you wish to disable it for a clearer view, you can use this command to toggle it on/off:

perspective occlusion

(this can be disabled seperately from perspective mode so you can have it disabled in normal 2D view too if you like)

Also I've added a command that allows playing the game in 4:3 aspect ratio. Use this if you have a CRT monitor as those are typically 4:3 aspect ratio:
